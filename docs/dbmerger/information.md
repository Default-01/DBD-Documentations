# Information

Here is some general information about the app to help you get started.

DB Merger is used to merge multiple databases from multiple tables into one database. The app has a ton of features and is very customizable. You can find all the configuration options [**here**](/docs/dbmerger/configuration).

## How it works

This app basically takes all specified columns from all specified tables and merges them into one big table, you have to specify one indentifier shown below in the blue cells in the image. The app will search all tables for the identifier and if it finds a match it will merge the row with the other rows that have the same identifier.

This way you can merge multiple databases into one big database and use it for whatever you want.

## Supported Databases

The app only supports MySQL databases at the moment, but I am planning on adding support for more databases in the future. eventually I want to add support for all databases, even mongoDB!
